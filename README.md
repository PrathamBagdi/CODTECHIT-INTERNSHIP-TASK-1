# Overview of the Project

### **Project:** Simple Calculator
The objective of this code is to create a user-friendly calculator in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with error handling and the option for multiple calculations without restarting the program.

### Key Activities
**User Interface:** Displaying operation choices and prompting for user input.
**Arithmetic Operations:** Implementing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Error Handling:** Managing potential errors like division by zero.
**Interactive Loop:** Allowing users to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program.

### Key Insights
**Modularity:** 
Functions **(add, subtract, multiply, divide)** enhance code organization and reusability by encapsulating specific operations.

**User Interaction:** 
The use of **input()** and formatted output **(print())** ensures clear communication and interaction with the user.

**Error Management:** 
Handling potential errors such as division by zero ensures robustness and prevents program crashes.

**Recursive Functionality:** 
The recursive call in **calculator()** allows for repeated operations, improving user convenience.

**Structured Flow:** 
The **while** loop and conditional statements structure the program flow, providing a seamless user experience for multiple calculations.
